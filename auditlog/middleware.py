        This line allows the user to be saved with the log entry my manually authenticating the token
        django-audit-log can't recognize from a DRF request whether a user is authenticated or not
        so we have to make a manual call to our authenticator - JWTAuthentication.
        Since middleware runs before the request authentication done by JWTAuthentication, this
        is the quickfix I came up with.
        It's in a try catch loop because if the user authenticates the first time, the authenticate
        function would return an error since the user object doesn't exists yet.
